This is a software development project in my spare time focused on improving my skills as a developer.

Together with a colleague from the University, we are developing a web-store based on microservices written in Go/Golang and Java, our project is purely academic and in it, we are applying concepts such as:

- Architecture concepts of API Gateway - Interoperability Models - Patterns API
- Microservices architecture at scale, using Java and Spring Boot
- Use of third-party libraries such as OAuth (Authentication), Twilio (Notifications), KrakenD (API Gateway), etc.
- C4Models, a new way of diagramming for Agile projects
- Ship/Show/Ask, a new Git flow to be more agile and deliver more value in the shortest possible time.
- GitLab CI, an interesting DevSecOps tool to do software projects with everything you need.
- Unit testing and integration testing.

And all this has led us to conceive an interesting idea: zero-cost DevOps, as software development enthusiasts how can we start a software project without spending a single penny? our intention is to share our experience with the community through a blog that we will write when we have a product to show,

Also, we take the opportunity to train an enthusiast with little experience in the software world who is looking to improve his quality of life, our personal philosophy is: that teaching is learning, and teaching is the best way to reduce inequality.This is a software development project in my spare time focused on improving my skills as a developer.
